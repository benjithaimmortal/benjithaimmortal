A README, from Benji

I mean, only if you want to.

I'm not forcing it.

It's not really my place to use the imperative here.

Why are you here, anyway?

I don't like your tone.

But I guess I didn't like my tone either.

Who demands that someone read, in this day in age?

I'm not your English teacher... anymore.
